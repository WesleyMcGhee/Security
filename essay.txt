Marriott International
2014-2018

In 2014 a group of hackers got into the starwood server that belonged to Marriott Hotel, they would continue to be in this server for four years until
one day in Septermber of 2018.  Going throught the details of the the attack, and Marriott CEO Arne Sorensons testimony to the U.S. Senate, we dont know
how they got any of their software onto the server, but we do know how they got in.  This data breach affected over 500 million of Marriotts customers,
this happened after a Remote Access Trojan(RAT), was installed onto the the server, along with MimiKatz.  Now it is most likely that this was put onto 
the server by a phishing email, that downloaeded the virus to the computer, but what is RAT, and MimiKatz. RAT is a Trojan horse virus that installs
onto your computer as  a harmless file, but then becomes harmful as it can be used to mine data, or encrypt your files.  MimiKatz, is a password cracking
software developed to expose some of microsofts insecurites, this was made to be something that was used for Penn testing but got picked up the the black
hat hackers as well.  This gave access to password hashes, of administrators.  They were able to get onto the administrators side of the server, and access
100 million credit card numbers, and expiration dates.  Moral of the story is, look at the attachments to all emails that you open.
